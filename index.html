                    <p>Before you can practice something new, whether it is learning to juggle or forming a cutting-edge marketing strategy, you must first know yourself. 
                        Setting underlying goals and motivations in your mind allows you to act with purpose (even if you happen to drop the ball.)</p>

                                    In a fixed mindset, people believe their qualities are fixed traits and therefore cannot change. These people document their intelligence and talents rather than working to develop and improve them. They also believe that talent alone leads to success, and effort is not required. 
                                    People with a fixed mindset tend to spend a lot of their time and effort to prove their worth and intelligence because they believe that they have a set amount.

                                    In a growth mindset, people have an underlying belief that their learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. When people believe they can become smarter, they realize that their effort influences their success, so they put in extra time, leading to higher achievement.
                                    <br>
                                    People with a growth mindset believe their abilities and intelligence can be developed with effort, learning, and persistence. Their basic abilities are simply a starting point for their potential. They don't believe everyone is the same, but they hold onto the idea that everyone can improve if they try.

                        <p>One way to examine and change your mindset over time is to ask yourself where you are in any present moment. 
                            Are you approaching the situation with growth in mind? or are you fixating on what cannot be changed?

                         No one person is the same, which makes self-reflection and practice necessary as you fluctuate between 
                         a fixed and growth mindset in whatever the context might be.

A growth mindset and Agile transformation will allow you to work more effectively (speed being one of the benefits), but only when it is properly understood and monitored over time. It’s common to try and change everything at once, and feeling disheartened when it often fails. Pace yourself.

                                To achieve anything, you must first feel capable of achieving it. Self-esteem comes from your internal dialogue and dictates how you see your personal worth (for better or worse). 

                                A strong and positive mindset develops a healthy self-esteem by reinforcing positive beliefs, attitudes and feelings instead of criticism and doubt.

                                Our perspective is the meaning we attach to the events and circumstances in our lives. The perspective we formulate plays a significant role on whether we take an optimistic or negative approach to problems. Tony Robbins notes that “Nothing in life has any meaning except the meaning we give it.” 

                                Having an optimistic mindset increases the likelihood of formulating a winning perspective and achieving long-term success.

                                Without an unwavering kind of drive, it would be difficult to achieve any worthwhile goal. More than momentary motivation, real drive involves developing your winning perspective and sustaining the right amount of effort.

                                A growth mindset awakens your personal power to commit to a higher purpose instead of wasting time grumbling over the circumstances. This type of focus urges someone to challenge the status quo and push past comfort zones.
